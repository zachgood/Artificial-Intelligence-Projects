Then I saw an example in the \"Local Search in Discrete State and Action Spaces\" notes that ebf(0, 0) was simply 0 and ebf(1, 1) was 0.0078125.  So I commented these ValueErrors out and simply returned 0 when nNodes was less than 1 or depth was less than 0.  \n",

    "The **aStarSearch function** uses the start state (**startState**), valid actions function (**actionsF**), action application function (**takeActionF**), goal test function (**goalTestF**), and heuristic function passed (**hF**), to make a new node.  It then uses this node to call the **aStarSearchHelper function** to recursively best-search.  This is helpful because the user of the aStarSearch function doesnt need to know how to use the node class at all.  It also keeps track of the f, g, and h values to find the next best child node to explore.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A majority of this code was taken from the notes \"07 Informed Search\" from 440 lecture but modified slightly.  The code in the 07 notes actually has a error when trying to search for a node that does not exist.  However, for this assignment, we were told that we may assume that the goal is reachable. Failure will not happen for any of the tests run when grading your solution.  Even so, I use a try catch for the call to aStarSearchHelper to catch \"RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded\" and return failure.\n",

    "**Using lambda to call aStarSearch**\n",

    "An interesting piece of these functions is that aStarSearchHelper only passes one argument to goalTestF and hF when they are called.  Originally, I thought that goalState was forgotten as an argument in the definition of aStarSeach.  But then I saw the example provided that used lambda to pass the goal state when calling aStarSearch.  I was very unfamilar with using lambda to do anything other than sort lists.  After reading posts on piazza and some google research, I figured out how python was interprateing this.  Here is some text about lambda from 'https://www.python-course.eu/lambda.php':\n",
    "- \"The lambda operator or lambda function is a way to create small anonymous functions, i.e. functions without a name. These functions are throw-away functions, i.e. they are just needed where they have been created.\"\n",
    "- \"The general syntax of a lambda function is quite simple: `lambda argument_list: expression`.\n",
    "The argument list consists of a comma separated list of arguments and the expression is an arithmetic expression using these arguments. You can assign the function to a variable to give it a name.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, a new function is beind defined when calling lambda in this case.  This function is identical to the goal test function or heuristic function already defined, but when it is called in the aStar functions, it passes the goal state provided as the second arguement.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "TL;DR: \n",
    "- Problem: 1.) aStar functions only pass the current state to goalTestF and hF.  2.) My goalTestF's and hF's require two arguments; state, goal.\n",
    "- Solution: Use lambda to define a new function with a hardcoded goal argument for goalTestF and hF"
