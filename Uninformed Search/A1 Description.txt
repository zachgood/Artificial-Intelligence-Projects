This was the first project from CS 440.
Breadth-first and depth-first are two algorithms for performing uninformed search---a search that does not use knowledge about the goal of the search. 
I implemented both search algorithms in python and tested them on a simple graph.
The simple graph was a tree that was connected by a dictionary where the keys were parent nodes that mapped to values that were their child nodes.
For extra credit, I applied an algorithm to solve another puzzle.
